# Godot-6DOF-Vehicle-Demo
Demo using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) [Generic 6DOF joints](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_generic6dofjoint.html) to make a fully working, physics based vehicle.

The physics and joints setup is exactly the same I use on my racing game [TrackMaster: Free-For-All Motorsport](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536740/TrackMaster_FreeForAll_Motorsport/).

After 1.5 year of development of TrackMaster, I decided to make a free and open source demo of the basics of how the game vehicles works. Every time I've posted videos of TrackMaster's updates, I always received questions about how I made the physics, and how I use joints. Seeing how there is little to no educational resources (tutorials) on 6DOF joints in Godot, I decided it was time to make a small contribution to the Godot community, and this is also a way to say "thank you" to this ever growing and awesome community.

This demo contains:

1. A main scene, with obstacles and ramps, as static bodies.
2. A working, physics based, monster truck like vehicle, based on 6DOF joints, with the script that make it works.
3. The blend file used for the vehicle visual instance (mesh).
4. Two additional scenes, with no scripts, showing the very basics of 6DOF joints.

Physics run on 240 FPS.

Use this demo the way you like it, it's completely free.

**WARNING: As of July 2021, this demo only works with Bullet physics.**

I may update this demo in the future. Please, share your opinion, feedback and request for more features.

I also may make a video tutorial in the future, explaining every detail.
