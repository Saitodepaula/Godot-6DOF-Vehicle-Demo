# Godot-6DOF-Vehicle-Demo
Demo using Godot Generic 6DOF joints to make a fully working, physics based vehicle.

The physics and joints setup is exactly the same I use on my racing game [TrackMaster: Free-For-All Motorsport](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536740/TrackMaster_FreeForAll_Motorsport/).

This demo contains:

1. A main scene, with obstacles and ramps, as static bodies.
2. A working, physics based, monster truck like vehicle, based on 6DOF joints, with the script that make it works.
3. The blend file used for the vehicle visual instance (mesh).
4. Two additional scenes, with no scripts, showing the very basics of 6DOF joints.

Physics run on 240 FPS.

Use this demo the way you like it, it's completely free.

**WARNING: As of July 2021, this demo only works with Bullet physics.**

I may update this demo in the future. Please, share your opinion, feedback and request for more features.
